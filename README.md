# Ruft - Raft Consensur Protocol in Rust

This is a personal project in which I will explore an implementation of the Raft Consensus Protocol in Rust. My goal is to learn the protocol with a simple local application and then actually extend it to be a proper implementation that can be hosted on separate machines.

The end goal is to have a framework on which you could build your distributed applications. A common use case could be to build a replicated strongly consistent key value store.
